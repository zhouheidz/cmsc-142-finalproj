## Files and Folders

### GenerateGraphData.java
This generates arrays of size 1 up to 100 with random numbers. The numbers are then sorted in ascending, descending, or are not sorted at all.

Generated files are **ascending.txt**, **descending.txt**, and **random.txt**

To compile
```
javac GenerateGraphData.java
```

To run
```
java GenerateGraphData
```

### src > sorting.order.and.statistic > SortingOrderAndStatistics.java
This contains all the sorting algorithms required, and generates the images of the graphs. This is compiled using **NetBeans IDE**, and may not work on regular java compilers.

### Graphs
This folder contains the generated graphs of **SortingOrderAndStatistics.java**. 

### dist > lib > jcommon-1.0.0.jar & jfreechart-1.0.1.jar
Third-party libraries by JFreeChart that allows graphing in Java. 

### Rest of the files and folders
Generated by NetBeans upon instantiation of the new project. Do not touch if you don't want the project to break
